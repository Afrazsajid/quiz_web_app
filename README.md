## Introduction
---------------

Hey there! I'm excited to share with you a small project I built using a cool API I discovered. As a developer, I'm always looking for ways to practice and improve my skills, and this project was a great opportunity to do just that. Plus, I wanted to share a small project with my class on Sunday, and this seemed like the perfect fit!

--------------------

* Implement a feature to close the app when the timer runs out
* Add pre-built beautiful alerts for a better user experience
* Add a feature to choose categories for the questions

## Future Features (Suggestions Welcome!)
----------------------------------------

* Leaderboard to keep track of scores
* User authentication to save progress
* More question categories and types (e.g., multiple choice, true/false)

This project was a fun way to practice my development skills and share something with my class. If you have any suggestions or ideas for future features, please let me know! I'm always looking for ways to improve and expand this project.
